 Agent Design for Treasure Hunt Game (PEAS):


Performance	Collect all treasures, avoid walls, fewest steps
Environment	2D maze grid with walls and treasures
Actuators	Player movement (up, down, left, right)
Sensors	             Grid state, player position, treasure locations



ODESDA for Treasure Hunt Game:


Property	Value
Observable	Fully Observable
Deterministic	Deterministic
Episodic	Sequential
Static	             Static
Discrete	Discrete
Agent	            Single Agent


 Agent Basic Type: Goal-based agent

Problem Formulation:


Initial State	             Player starts at position (0, 0) on the grid.
Actions   	             Player can move Up, Down, Left, or Right if the target cell is not a wall (grid value ≠ 1).
Transition Model	Player can move from current position (r, c) to adjacent position (r′, c′) if grid[r′][c′] ≠ 1 (i.e., the target cell is not a wall).
Goal Test	            The goal is to reach any cell that contains a treasure (grid value = 2).
Path Cost	            Each move has a cost of 1. Total path cost = number of moves taken to reach the treasure.
